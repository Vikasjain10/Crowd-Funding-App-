# Crowd-Funding-App-

The problem Together We Fund solves
Crowdfunding can be expensive and centralized, with many platforms taking a large percentage of the funds raised as fees. Our Crowdfunding Web App aims to solve this problem by using blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform that allows users to fund their ideas and make a difference without intermediaries or high fees. With our app, anyone can take control of their fundraising efforts and connect with supporters worldwide. As we are using blockchain technology this app will provide funds from local and international. This WebApp provides funds received by the user
in cryptocurrency.

Challenges we ran into
We had spent an extreme time of how to connect to the meta mask and how to connect the wallet to the code.
We were new to web3 soo we decided to use simple design so that it will be user friendly. As we were new to polygon we had to read the docs and stuff to implement it to the web.

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract --template hardhat-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `contracts/Contract.sol`.

To add functionality to your contracts, you can use the `@thirdweb-dev/contracts` package which provides base contracts and extensions to inherit. The package is already installed with this project. Head to our [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) to learn more.

## Building the project

After any changes to the contract, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

to compile your contracts. This will also detect the [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) detected on your contract.

## Deploying Contracts

When you're ready to deploy your contracts, just run one of the following command to deploy you're contracts:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```

## Releasing Contracts

If you want to release a version of your contracts publicly, you can use one of the followings command:

```bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
```
Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.jsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app,
this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
