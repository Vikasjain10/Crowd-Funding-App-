# Crowd-Funding-App-

The problem Together We Fund solves
Crowdfunding can be expensive and centralized, with many platforms taking a large percentage of the funds raised as fees. Our Crowdfunding Web App aims to solve this problem by using blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform that allows users to fund their ideas and make a difference without intermediaries or high fees. With our app, anyone can take control of their fundraising efforts and connect with supporters worldwide. As we are using blockchain technology this app will provide funds from local and international. This WebApp provides funds received by the user
in cryptocurrency.

Challenges we ran into
We had spent an extreme time of how to connect to the meta mask and how to connect the wallet to the code.
We were new to web3 soo we decided to use simple design so that it will be user friendly. As we were new to polygon we had to read the docs and stuff to implement it to the web.
